1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements?
setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);

setTimeout(booyah, 2000): booyah function will run after 2 seconds.
setTimeout(booyah(), 2000): booyah function will run immediately.

2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
var myfunc = function(a, x) {
 return a * x;
};
var x = myfunc(2, 3);
var y = myfunc;
alert(x);
alert(y(2,3));

Will display '6' two times.


3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that
says â€œBOOYAH!â€
setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);

function booyah1(){
    alert('â€œBOOYAH!');
}

4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons
for using it)?

Unobtrusive JavaScript is a general approach to the use of JavaScript in web pages.
Unobtrusive JavaScript runs without drawing attention to itself. The script is a useful addtion to the website, but it is so integrated, and works so well that the user simply uses the website (and its scripts) without thinking about it.
